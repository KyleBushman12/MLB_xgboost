# MLB_xgboost

This repo contains all materials for an XGBoost model built to predict the outcome of MLB games. This includes the gathered data, data cleaning, data organizing, calculations, model building, model evaluation and data visulaization. The code is designed to update daily and predict the outcomes of MLB games for that day. However, for the purposes of posting here, I have included datra from the last MLB game of the year to be predicted on. The code is easily modifiable to predict any game going forward.
